# Thoughts for a proposed meeting [Open Source and W3C Standardization](https://doodle.com/poll/tu4kyvkfmscfnres)

it would be great if all of us could share why the topic is of
interest, and what you hope might emerge from a more structured
conversation 

## Role of OSS browser projects
* Big companies that control the projects do most of the implementaiton;
* code first not spec first
* Standards orgs coordinate /facilitate more than drive
* But formal process documents still describe a spec-first process with multiple independent implementations necessary to advance
* How can process describe and shape reality without rubberstamping?
* Examples: WOFF, WebRTC are Recommendations with only one OSS implementation 
* Testing ....
* Martin Thomson's post on the relations between standards, tests & implementations  https://lowentropy.net/posts/standard-principles/

## Possible solutions
* Open governance of major OSS projects
* 


* some significant pieces of technology (WebRTC being particularly close
to my heart) rely on a single open source library; while such a library
can end up being used differently in different implementations, it
remains that this means at least part of the "double implementation"
check in the W3C process gets much more limited in depth in these
situations. It may be that a structured approach at documenting these
limitations and identifying possible mitigations if they're necessary
would help bring clarity to WGs, improve our interop impact.

* more fundamentally, as Mike Champion has noted many times, some
conversations that might have happened as standard discussions when the
goal was interoperability between proprietary systems have migrated
towards discussions on code contributions & governance in a shared open
source project; what does this mean for the long term future of the Web
& W3C? I thought Martin Thomson's post on the relations between
standards, tests & implementations brought (indirectly) some interesting
considerations to that question
